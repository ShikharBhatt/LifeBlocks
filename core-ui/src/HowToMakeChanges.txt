This is an example of how to make changes or while creating your own components and adding in the core ui template.


Procedure:

1. Rename the Folders and Files Accordingly.

2. Then make necessary changes in src/_nav.js and src/routes.js

3. Every folder has an index.js file, so make changes in that.

4. Every sub-folder in the /views directory has a package.json file(you can make changes in that file as well(not necessary)




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is the output of git status after you make changes:



In this example I've changed the theme folder to records and the sub-folders have also
been changed to ViewRecords(instead of Colors) and ShareRecords(instead of Typography) respectively.
